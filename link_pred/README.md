# Link Prediction Methods using Graphon Estimation

This folder contains Python implementations of several **graphon-based link prediction algorithms** used for estimating edge probabilities in real-world and synthetic networks. These methods are evaluated under a masking-based testing protocol on six benchmark datasets. The overall goal is to assess how well graphon estimation (with or without transfer) can recover **missing or future links** in graphs.

| Script         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `USVD.py`      | Universal Singular Value Decomposition. Performs low-rank SVD on adjacency matrices for link recovery. |
| `NS.py`        | Neighborhood Smoothing. Nonparametric method using local averaging to estimate edge probabilities. |
| `SAS.py`       | Sorted and Smoothed graphon estimator. Reorders nodes by degree and applies smoothing on sorted matrix. |
| `ICE.py`       | Iterative Connecting Probability Estimator. Alternates between estimation and binning. |
| `Transfer.py`  | Our proposed **GTRANS** transfer learning framework using Gromov-Wasserstein transport for structure alignment and estimation debiasing. |

## Experimental Setup

We evaluate link prediction performance using **six real-world graphs** spanning various domains:

| Dataset       | #Nodes | #Edges | Avg. Deg. | Density  |
|---------------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| dolphins      | 62     | 159    | 5.13      | 0.0841   |
| karate        | 34     | 78     | 4.59      | 0.1390   |
| football      | 115    | 613    | 10.66     | 0.0935   |
| firm          | 33     | 91     | 5.52      | 0.1723   |
| hamster       | 2,426  | 16,630 | 13.71     | 0.0057   |
| wiki-vote (*) | 889    | 2,914  | 6.56      | 0.0074   |

> (*) `wiki-vote` is used as the **source graph** for transfer. All others are treated as target graphs.

We randomly mask 10% of edges in the upper triangle of each adjacency matrix to form a **test set**, then use graphon-based methods to estimate the full probability matrix and compute predictions on the masked entries.

## Evaluation Metrics

We follow the AUC evaluation protocol from the literature ([61], [43]):

- Let \( \hat{P}_{ij} \) be the estimated edge probability
- Use held-out entries \( (i,j) \) with known ground-truth label \( A_{ij} \in \{0, 1\} \)
- Compute ROC curve over thresholds \( t \in (0,1) \), and then compute the **Area Under Curve (AUC)**
